Wine Quality Prediction Project üç∑

This repository demonstrates my journey of analyzing and predicting wine quality using machine learning techniques. Through this project, I explored:

Data Cleaning: Identified and handled missing values, duplicates, and encoded categorical features for consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized the relationships between wine characteristics and quality ratings.
Model Building: Built classification models like Decision Trees, Random Forest, and ExtraTrees to predict wine quality.
Performance Evaluation: Used LazyPredict to quickly benchmark model performance.
This project is my way of learning and applying machine learning concepts while sharing insights from this fascinating dataset.
